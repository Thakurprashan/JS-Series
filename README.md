                                                        DAY-1 Topics Covered :

1.Hoisting in java script. Hoisting is a default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top

2.Operators in java script.

Arithmetic operators are symbols that perform mathematical operations on numbers.

+ Addition

- Subtraction

*Multiplication

/Division

% Remainder

Comparison operators compare values and return a Boolean value of true or false.

== Checks if two operands are equal

!= Checks if two operands are not equal

<: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand

: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand

<= Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand

= Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand


                                                               Day 2 Topics Covered :

1.The Increment Operator (++)
 The increment operator (++) adds 1 from the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the increment.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the increment.

2.The Decrement Operator (--)
 The decrement operator (--) subtracts 1 to the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the decrement.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the decrement.
 
3.Logical Operators
 a. && and
 b. || or
 c. ! not

                                                             Day 3 Topics Covered :

1.Decision Making
Decision Making in programming is needed to make the logical decision for doing some operation.

if statement: It is used if some statement has to be executed based on single condition. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e. if a certain condition is true then the block of statement is executed otherwise not.

if-else statement: It is used when some set of code has to be executed based on some given conditions otherwise another set of code has to be executed. The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false then else block executed. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

Switch-Statement: It is used when multiple condition has to be evaluated based on single variable expression.

2.prompt() method
The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the user for input.
