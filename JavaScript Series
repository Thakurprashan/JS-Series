== Checks if two operands are equal

!= Checks if two operands are not equal

1.The Increment Operator (++)
 The increment operator (++) adds 1 from the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the increment.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the increment.

2.The Decrement Operator (--)
 The decrement operator (--) subtracts 1 to the operand.
 If it is placed after the operand, it returns the value before the decrement.
 If it is placed before the operand, it returns the value after the decrement.
 
3.Logical Operators

b. || or
c. ! not
